# Tracking Wine

## Overview

- Groups of 4 - 5 people
- 1st hour:
    - Requirements
    - Design activity diagram
- break
- 2nd hour:
    - Discussion: another group's design
    - Design class diagram
    - Discussion: another group's design

# Case Study

## <img src="img/SwissFlag.png" style="vertical-align:middle"/> Startup Idea

>- Swiss love their **wine** and cheese
>- Let's create a *simple* wine tracker system

## La Cave Vivante

## Simple idea

>- Bottles have a RFID tag
>- RFID reader (emits and read signal)
>- **Raspberry Pi**
>- **Server (online shop)**
>- Mobile app

## Simple idea

## Simple idea

## Requirements I

The Raspberry Pi needs to handle:

>- Bottles in
>- Bottles out
>- Communication with server
>- Addition: Cellar identity (update cellar)
>- Addition: Employees have Tag (identity)
>- Important: Unreachable server?

<div class="notes">
  What happens when the server is unreachable?
</div>

## Requirements II

The online shop needs to handle:

>- credit cards,
>- invoices,
>- manage cellar (incr / dec)
>- auto-order ( #wine < 5 => send more)
>- auto-order alerts (emails, sms, etc)
>- drink with responsibility alarm
>- ...


## Activity Diagram

![](img/ActivityDiagram.jpeg)

>- <span style="font-size: 25pt">Models control flow (of sequence) of activities</span>
>- <span style="font-size: 25pt">Represents business ideas rather than implementation</span>
>- <span style="font-size: 25pt">High level understanding</span>

## Activity Diagram (work in groups)

## Break


## Class Diagram

- Static view of the application
- Represent software entities (classes, interfaces, etc)
- High level overview of the implementation [1]

## Class Diagram (work in groups)

## Hint: Domain objects

>- Wine
>- Tag ID
>- Location
>- Region
>- Cellar
>- Type of grape
>- User
>- RFID reader (polls data)
>- Server (where to send data)
>- Online shop (credit card, emails, sms, alerts)

## Conclusion

- Activity diagram
    - convey general idea (business)
    - sequence of steps
- Static diagram
    - models software entities
    - static view
